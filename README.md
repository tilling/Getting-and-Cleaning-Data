# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Work for Getting and Cleaning Data class
The script run_analysis.R should be usable from the top-level folder. It is meant to be used in the folder arrangement in which the data came: there are subfolders called "train" and "test", each of which has files that provide the main data, the list of subjects for the data rows, and the list of activities for the data rows.
In the main folder there is the file "activity_labels.txt" which links the activity codes with actual names. The file "features.txt" gives the original variable names for the measured quantities.
It was not possible to upload the data itself into this repository, so I am hoping that you have the data on your own disk in the arrangement above!
